not tested.

## What works

We tested these on a Quest 3S. We did not test on a Quest 3.

- The full main story. We played from Kokiri Forest to Ganon's Tower.
- The first-start setup. The panel asks for the ROM, the headset makes
  `oot.o2r`, and the game starts in VR. We tested it with the European
  GameCube version.
- Stereo render, first-person camera, and head tracking.
- Automatic world scale for child Link and adult Link.
- Quick Setup in VR Settings: view, sword hand, right stick (items or turn),
  item selector or C buttons, and HUD position. The first start asks how the
  player wants to turn.
- The physical sword and shield with the Touch controllers. The shield blocks
  with its full size, and the Mirror Shield reflects the Twinrova beams.
- Menus and the pause screen on a floating panel.
- The SoH menu with the Touch controllers and a laser pointer.
- The wrist HUD. Hearts, magic, and rupees show on the off-hand wrist when you
  look at it. The item buttons show above the sword-hand controller.
