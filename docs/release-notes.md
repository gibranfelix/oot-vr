# Release notes

These rules apply to the notes of each release on GitHub.

A tag `v*` starts `release.yml`. The workflow publishes the APK with notes that
GitHub makes. Replace these notes with the template below.

- Write in English, in ASD-STE100.
- Write for the player. Tell what changed in the game, not in the code.
- Start each item with one bold sentence. Link the pull request. Add one or two
  short sentences only if the player must know more.
- Use only the sections that have items. Do not add changes to the
  documentation or to CI.
- In "Known problems", link only open issues.
- Set the title to `oot-vr vX.Y.Z-beta`.

```md
# oot-vr vX.Y.Z-beta
